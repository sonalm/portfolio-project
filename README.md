This project analyses the dataset available at Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult with the goal to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year.

After Exploratory Data Analsis, common algorithms used for for classification problem are modeled with default params. 
Later we are trying to improve the performance of models by tuning the hyperparameters.

With updated models, we identified that Random Forest performs best with about 86% accuracy rate in identifying if the person earns more than 50K a year or yet.

Looking at the random forest visualizer, we can also provide some explanibilty to the results. 
The notebook provides visualization for first decision tree in the random forest.
